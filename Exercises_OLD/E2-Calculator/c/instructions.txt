write a function that takes 2 floating point numbers and returns their quotient
if y is 0, print "cannot divide by 0" and return 0
float fDivide(float x, float y)


to test your program, compile the compileThis.c file in the .apex directory 
clang -o test ../../../.apex/compileThis.c
gcc -o test ../../../.apex/compileThis.c
then simply run the executable whenever you want to test your code
