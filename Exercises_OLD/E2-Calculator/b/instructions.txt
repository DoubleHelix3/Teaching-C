write a function that takes 2 integers and returns their quotient truncated to the nearest integer
do not worry about the case where y is 0 in this part
int truncatedDivision(int x, int y)

write a function that takes 2 integers and returns the remainder you get when dividing x by y after long division
int remainderAfterDivision(int x, int y)

write a function that takes 2 integers and prints "%d r %d" 
where the first %d is their quotient truncated and the second %d is their remainder
void printDivisionWithRemainder(int x, int y)


to test your program, compile the compileThis.c file in the .apex directory 
clang -o test ../../../.apex/compileThis.c
gcc -o test ../../../.apex/compileThis.c
then simply run the executable whenever you want to test your code
