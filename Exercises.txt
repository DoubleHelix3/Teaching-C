2. Calculator
			a. Write functions that takes in 2 integers and returns their:
						- sum
						- difference
						- product

			b. Write functions that takes in 2 integers and returns their:
						- quotient after long division
						- remainder after long division
			Write another function that takes in two integer and prints
			the quotient followed by "r" followed by the remainder

			c. Write a function that takes in two floats and returns their
			quotient.  If y is 0, print "cannot divide by 0" and return 0

								- double triangleArea(double base, double height)
						- circumference of a circle
						- area of a circle
						- area of an ellipse

3. Booleans
			a. Write a function to test if an integer is negative.
			Write a function that checks if two integers are the same sign.
			Write a function that takes in two points, and checks out if they're
			in the same quadrant.

			b. Implement the following functions: xor, nand, implies

			c. Write a function that tells you what stage of life you are in.
						- void printLifeStage(int age)
						- if you're less than 3, print "You are a baby owo"
						- if you're between 3 and 13, print "You are a child :)"
						- if you're between 13 and 19, print "You are a teenager"
						- if you're between 20 and 49, print "You are an adult! -.-"
						- if you're older than 49, print "You are old :("
			Consider the edge cases where the user inputs a non realistic age:
						- if the age entered is negative, print "How are you a negative
						age?"
						- if the age entered greater than 120, print "How are you older
						than the oldest person alive!" 
						- do not print anything else for the edge cases
			Write a function that tells you what you can legally do at an age
			in the US 
						- if you're able to drive, print "You can drive!"
						- if you're able to vote, print "You can vote!"
						- if you're able to drink, print "You can drink!"
			Handle the edge cases in the same way

			a. Write a program that takes in an integer n
						- this function should print the numbers from 1 to n
						in a comma separated list
						
			b. Write a function that takes in a string str and an integer n
						- the function will print the string str n times
						- void echo(char *str, int n)

			c. Write a function that calculates the nth fibonacci number.  If
			n is not an acceptable input, return 0. 

			d. Write a program that takes in an integer n and printsa tower
			of height n

					*
					- 5 ->
					*
					**
