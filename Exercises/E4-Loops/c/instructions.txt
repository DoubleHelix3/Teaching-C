write a function that calculates the nth fibonacci number
the sequence goes 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,... and starts at n=1
if n is not an acceptable input, return 0

int fibonacci(int n)


to test your program, compile the compileThis.c file in the .apex directory 
clang -o test ../../../.apex/compileThis.c
gcc -o test ../../../.apex/compileThis.c
then simply run the executable whenever you want to test your code
