write a function that takes in an integer n
and prints a tower of height n
run the test executable to understand what this means
void tower(int n)

to test your program, compile the compileThis.c file in the .apex directory 
clang -o test ../../../.apex/compileThis.c
gcc -o test ../../../.apex/compileThis.c
then simply run the executable whenever you want to test your code
