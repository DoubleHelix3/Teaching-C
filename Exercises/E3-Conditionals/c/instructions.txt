write a function that tells you what stage of life you are in
specifically: 
if you're less than 3, print "You are a baby owo"
if you're between 3 and 13, print "You are a child :)"
if you're between 13 and 19, print "You are a teenager"
if you're between 20 and 49, print "You are an adult! -.-"
if you're older than 49, print "You are old :("

consider the edge cases where the user inputs a non realistic age,
if the age entered is negative, print "How are you a negative age?"
if the age entered greater than 120, print "How are you older than the oldest person alive!" 
do not print anything else for the edge cases

void printLifeStage(int age)


write a function that tells you what you can legally do at an age in the US
specifically: 
if you're able to drive, print "You can drive!"
if you're able to vote, print "You can vote!"
if you're able to drink, print "You can drink!"

handle the edge cases for this function the same way as the other funtion

void printLegalActivities(int age)


to test your program, compile the compileThis.c file in the .apex directory 
clang -o test ../../../.apex/compileThis.c
gcc -o test ../../../.apex/compileThis.c
then simply run the executable whenever you want to test your code
