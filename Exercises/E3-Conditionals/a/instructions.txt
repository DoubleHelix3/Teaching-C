write a function to test if an integer is negative
bool isNegative(int x)

write a function that checks if two integers are the same sign
bool areSameSign(int x, int y)

write a function that takes in two points and checks if they're in the same quadrant
bool areSameQuadrant(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2)


to test your program, compile the compileThis.c file in the .apex directory 
clang -o test ../../../.apex/compileThis.c
gcc -o test ../../../.apex/compileThis.c
then simply run the executable whenever you want to test your code
